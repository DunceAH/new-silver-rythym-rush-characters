# CHANGELOG

-MADE WINTER SILVER SPRITES

#  THE CHARACTER JSONS ONLY WORK WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF PSYCH ENGINE

Uhh so I messed up the character proportions in adobe animate so they are way bigger than they should be. I changed their scale to "0.8" to make them size of normal fnf characters.

download the lua script file and drop it into the data chart folder of your song (or stage lua script) for silvers unique death anim
