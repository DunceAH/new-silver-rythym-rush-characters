# CHANGELOG

-MADE SEMI CORRUPTED ALT!

-fixed sprite chipping for corrupted silver

#  THE CHARACTER JSONS ONLY WORK WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF PSYCH ENGINE

Uhh so I messed up the character proportions in adobe animate so they are way bigger than they should be. I changed their scale to "0.8" to make them size of normal fnf characters.

download the lua script file and drop it into the data chart folder of your song (or stage lua scrip) for silvers unique death anim
